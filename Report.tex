\chapter{Introduction} % 200 words
With competition being a central component of the Robocode environment, it presents a very interesting platform for developing an AI. Given some core AI knowledge and a reasonable understanding of Java, the primary language used to develop Robocode robot tanks, as the AIs are called, anyone can attempt to create their own.

The aim of this coursework was to create a robot tank design for the Robocode environment, with the main objective being to be able to perform in a wide range of scenarios, such as both in melee combat (more than two robots) and one-to-one combat with just two robots and in battlefields of various sizes. The robot tank was to be based on the basic \texttt{Robot} class and not the more sophisticated \texttt{AdvancedRobot} class. While the environment may seem real-time, it is actually turn-based with robots taking simultaneous turns. %mention performance

This report presents the design of the robot tank submitted and its individual components. The robot tank is composed of its main logic, a radar component, a gun component, and a pilot (movement) component. Due to restrictions the gun component is merged into other components and two separate pilot components were designed, one more suitable for one-to-one combat and the other aimed at melee combat.

A detailed explanations of individual component is given, and the reasoning behind those components is explained. Notes on implementation details are also given to aid understanding of the submitted code.

Finally the chosen designs are compared between themselves and to other existing designs, and future expansion and improvements are outlined and suggested.

\chapter{Key Strategy Considerations} % 400 words

Given the reasonably mature age of the Robocode environment, many different strategies have appeared over the years, with a few showing the highest promise in terms of performance. Unfortunately most designs constrain themselves to two factors that are not present in the design of this robot tank - exclusive one-to-one combat and the availability of the \texttt{AdvancedRobot} class.

The key strategy considerations are listed below.

\section{Constraints of the Robot class}
Perhaps the most impactful constraint of the given task was the forced usage of the \texttt{Robot} class. Unlike the more sophisticated \texttt{AdvancedRobot} counterpart, the \texttt{Robot} class does not allow for non-blocking calls to movement functions. These functions include all six rotations available (radar, gun, tank; all in either direction) and the movement of the entire tank forwards or backwards. Firing is instantaneous and does not block.

The issue arising from blocking calls to these functions is that you are given a strict choice of either moving, aiming or properly scanning while being unable to do the remaining. While rotating the gun or the tank can help with scanning, it is far from as effective as proper scanning.

\subsection{Choice of operation}
From these constrains a key design decision is making an AI that can balance the three operations (aiming, moving and scanning) most effectively.

\subsection{Drawbacks of not aiming}
The drawbacks of not aiming is the high cost of having to aim your gun towards potential targets. A key design decision stemming from this drawback is to have the gun facing the potential targets as much as possible.

\subsection{Drawbacks of not moving}
The drawbacks of not moving are perhaps the most severe; the robot becomes the easiest target on the battlefield as it is not moving. A key design decision is to either move as much as possible.

\subsection{Drawbacks of insufficient scanning}
The drawbacks of insufficient scanning are having incomplete or outdated information of the battlefield. As both aiming and moving is dependent on having good information, insufficient scanning will directly impact the performance of all other components. The key design decision here is to perform scanning whenever not moving, and attempt to scan effectively while aiming.

\section{Melee and One-to-one Combat}
While most of the famous robot tanks and their strategies are designed for melee combat, the robot being designed should be suitable for melee combat too. The former allows for more counter-play and puts a great emphasis on avoiding all the opponent's shots, with almost all shots usually being accounted for, while melee combat generally emphasises using statistics to positioning the robot tank in a such a way that the fewest shots will hit, without being able to simulate all the shots being fired.

Unfortunately due to the constraints surrounding blocking calls to movement functions, most effective strategies currently employed by top robot tanks become extremely ineffective, and one-to-one combat becomes much harder due to being unable to constantly track the opponent's shots.


\chapter{Strategy Design} % 1000 words
This chapter discusses and justifies the designs used.

\section{Overview}
Due to the vast number of factors that have to be considered for a genetic algorithm, and similarly the vast number for cases that would have to be considered for an advanced rule-based system, in essence the design approached a plan-based system.

\section{Structure and Main Components}
The main code within \texttt{Robot.java} performs two main tasks.

Firstly it contains all the event handling, which is either passed on to relevant components to increase their knowledge of the battlefield, or causes an interrupt to perform emergency operations (such as distancing from walls, handling being crashed into, handling unplanned ramming).

Secondly it makes informed decisions as to the next goal to achieve. The goals are one of the following three, or a slight variation of one of them:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Scanning the battlefield
	\item Firing at a target
	\item Moving
\end{itemize}

Usually the first goal is to scan until sufficient information is acquired to select a target, and then the plan changes to fire at the target. This cycle is repeated until moving is required.

As firing at a target simultaneously performs limited scanning, it can often happen that firing is performed several times in a row, with the cycle returning to scanning only after the limited scanning does not produce sufficient information.

Moving is performed on a timed basis or triggered by getting hit. Data is collected from both being hit and hitting opponents in order to aid target selection and movement rules.
